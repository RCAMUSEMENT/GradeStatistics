# 📊 Grade Statistics Calculator
**Developed by Ryley**

This is a extremely robust Java console application that will calculate all of the essential classroom statistics, maps numeric scores to specific letter grades, and generates a visual distribution bar chart.

## 🚀 Features
*   **Safe Input:** Includes validation to prevent endless loops and handle invalid non-numeric data.
*   **Smart Sorting:** Automatically sorts grades from highest to lowest for clear reporting.
*   **Custom Grading Scale:** Maps scores to a precise scale (A through F, including +/-).
*   **Visual Distribution:** Generates a text-based histogram (bar chart) using asterisks.
*   **Advanced Stats:** Calculates Average, Maximum, Minimum, and Population Standard Deviation.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1.  Please make sure you have **Java (JDK 8 or higher)** installed.
2.  Save the code as `GradeStatistics.java`.
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the file location.
